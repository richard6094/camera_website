# Development Notes

## Recent Changes & Optimizations

### 2026-03-02: ParallaxQuote — Rounded Corners & Color-Matched Gradient Background
**Summary**: Added rounded corners to ParallaxQuote sections. Restructured component with outer `<section>` (padding) + inner `<div>` (rounded-2xl + overflow-hidden). Fixed mobile bottom-edge visibility by increasing background height to 130%. Added `topBg`/`bottomBg` props so the padding area uses a 50/50 linear gradient that exactly matches adjacent section backgrounds, eliminating color mismatch.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/components/ParallaxQuote.tsx` — Added `topBg`/`bottomBg` props, nested structure with rounded-2xl, gradient background, increased parallax image height to 130% with -15% top offset, reduced parallax multiplier to 0.08
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` — Pass `topBg`/`bottomBg` color tokens to both ParallaxQuote instances

**Rationale**: User requested rounded corners on parallax quotes, then iteratively fixed padding size and color mismatch between the parallax section's padding area and adjacent sections.

### 2026-03-02: Usage Scenes — Add Sample Images from Gallery
**Summary**: Added sample images from the Azure Blob Storage gallery to each of the 4 usage scenarios in the 35mm F/2 intro page. Each scene now displays a relevant photograph above the title and description.

**Image Assignments**:
- 人文街拍 (Street) → Portugal streets & trams (第1章 地域/葡萄牙)
- 环境人像 (Portrait) → People & Objects (第6章 人・物)
- 旅行纪实 (Travel) → Egypt travel (第1章 地域/埃及)
- 视频拍摄 (Video) → Neon night scenes (第4章 霓虹)

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2Intro.tsx` — Added `blobUrl` helper, added `image` field to scenes data, updated section layout with `aspect-[16/9] rounded-xl` image cards, increased `space-y` from 12 to 20

**Rationale**: User requested adding relevant sample photos to the usage scenes section for visual richness.

---

### 2026-03-02: Soft Wide-Screen Frame — Light Background + Rounded Corners
**Summary**: Replaced the dark (#000) wide-screen frame with a warm light-gray background. The outermost container and global header remain sharp-edged (no rounded corners) for a clean edge-to-edge appearance. Elevation shadows softened to complement the light background.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/index.css` — Changed `html { background-color: #000 }` → `oklch(0.92 0.006 60)` (warm light gray); softened elevation shadow values; removed heavy `section-raised` box-shadow (now z-index only)
- `client/src/App.tsx` — No rounded corners on outermost wrapper (sharp edge-to-edge)
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` — No rounded corners on header; kept `top-0` fixed positioning
- `docs/manus-context/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — Updated Site Max-Width and Elevation & Depth System sections

**Rationale**: User requested softer visual presentation on wide screens — light background instead of dark, rounded corners instead of sharp hard edges and color blocks. The rounded container + light bg creates a modern, refined "floating card" aesthetic that feels less harsh than the previous dark frame approach.

---

### 2026-03-02: Restore Full-Width Hero Section
**Summary**: Restored the Hero (HorizontalProductShowcase) to full viewport width, breaking out of the 1440px container constraint. Added `.full-bleed` CSS utility class for elements that need to span the full viewport width while remaining inside a max-width parent.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/index.css` — Added `.full-bleed` utility class (uses `width: 100vw; left: 50%; margin-left: -50vw` technique)
- `client/src/components/HorizontalProductShowcase.tsx` — Applied `full-bleed` class to the outer `<section>`
- `client/src/App.tsx` — Added `overflow-x-clip` to the site wrapper to prevent horizontal scrollbar from the full-bleed element

**Rationale**: After the 1440px constraint was applied, the Hero section was no longer full-screen. User requested restoring it to the original full-width design.

---

### 2026-03-02: Visual Depth & Elevation System
**Summary**: Added a multi-layer depth system to create visual hierarchy between different levels of content. Includes alternating surface backgrounds, elevation shadows, floating section effects, and recessed parallax bands.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/index.css` — Added `--surface-alt` CSS variable (light/dark modes), registered `--color-surface-alt` in Tailwind theme; added `.elevation-1/2/3`, `.section-raised`, `.section-inset` utility classes
- `client/src/App.tsx` — Added `elevation-3` to the 1440px site wrapper for floating panel shadow
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` — Added `boxShadow: '0 2px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)'` to fixed header for floating depth
- `client/src/components/ParallaxQuote.tsx` — Added `section-inset` class for recessed inner shadow effect
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` — Applied `section-raised` to Brand Story, Gallery, and Support sections; used `bg-surface-alt` on Gallery and Product Cards sections for alternating surface tones
- `client/src/components/ProductSelectionCards.tsx` — Changed section to `bg-surface-alt section-raised`; added `elevation-1 hover:elevation-2` to individual product cards

**Rationale**: User requested visual hierarchy/depth between different layers of components. The system creates:
- **Layer 0** (deepest): ParallaxQuote bands with inner shadow — appear recessed
- **Layer 1**: Content sections with `section-raised` — float above parallax
- **Layer 2**: Cards with `elevation-1/2` — pop off their parent surface
- **Layer 3**: Header and site wrapper — top-most floating elements

---

### 2026-03-02: Global Max-Width Constraint (1440px) for Wide Screen Optimization
**Summary**: Added a global max-width constraint of 1440px to the entire site layout, preventing content from stretching across ultra-wide screens. Content is centered with a dark frame background, inspired by tec.gov.ae's contained layout approach.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/index.css` — Added `html { background-color: #000; }` for dark frame outside content area
- `client/src/App.tsx` — Wrapped Router content in `max-w-[1440px] mx-auto` container with `bg-background` and `min-h-screen`
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` — Added `max-w-[1440px] mx-auto` to fixed header; restructured dropdown menu wrapper with max-width centering and `pointer-events-none/auto` passthrough

**Rationale**: User reported that full-width layout caused image distortion on wide screens. Constraining to 1440px prevents stretching while maintaining the editorial aesthetic. Dark html background creates a premium "floating content" frame effect, like a photographic print on dark matte.

---

### 2026-03-01: Global Button Rounded Corners
**Summary**: Changed global `--radius` design token from `0px` to `6px`, giving all buttons and UI components subtle rounded corners. Removed inline `borderRadius` workarounds from product page buttons.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/index.css` — `--radius: 0px` → `--radius: 6px` (yields `rounded-md`=4px, `rounded-lg`=6px)
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2.tsx` — Removed inline `borderRadius: '6px'` from quantity selector and purchase buttons, using Tailwind `rounded-md`/`rounded-l-md`/`rounded-r-md` classes instead
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2Special.tsx` — Same cleanup as above

**Rationale**: User requested subtle rounded corners on all buttons. Updating the design token is cleaner than per-button inline styles.

---

### 2026-03-01: Homepage UserGallery — Real Sample Photos & Full Uncropped Display
**Summary**: Replaced placeholder sample images in homepage UserGallery carousel with 7 real landscape photos from Azure Blob Storage (WebP), spanning chapters 1–5. Changed display from fixed-height `object-cover` (cropped) to natural aspect ratio `h-auto` (full uncropped) layout.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` — Replaced `/images/sample-*.jpg` placeholders with 7 Azure Blob Storage gallery URLs (landscape images from Geography, Color, Rhythm, Neon, Monochrome chapters)
- `client/src/components/UserGallery.tsx` — Removed fixed container heights (`h-[400px] sm:h-[500px] md:h-[600px] lg:h-[650px]`), removed `h-full` from flex/slides, changed image from `object-cover` to `w-full h-auto` for natural proportions

**Rationale**: User requested (1) real gallery photos instead of placeholders, (2) landscape-only images displayed at full size without cropping.

---

### 2026-02-28: Gallery Page & Azure Blob Storage Integration
**Summary**: Created dedicated `/gallery` page displaying 131 user sample photos from Azure Blob Storage, organized by 6 chapters. Added "查看更多" (View More) link to homepage gallery section heading. Updated header navigation to link to `/gallery` instead of homepage anchor `/#gallery`.

**Scope**:
- **Gallery page** (`Gallery.tsx`): Hierarchical navigation — chapter tabs (sticky) + section sub-tabs; displays one section at a time with masonry grid; prev/next navigation with position indicator; lightbox scoped to current section; trilingual chapter/section titles with subtitles
- **Homepage "View More"**: Positioned inline to the right of the "用户样片" heading with subtle underline + chevron, matching editorial design language
- **Header nav**: Gallery link changed from `/#gallery` anchor to `/gallery` route

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/Gallery.tsx` (new) — Section-at-a-time gallery with chapter/section tab navigation, masonry columns, lightbox, prev/next, position counter
- `client/src/App.tsx` — Added Gallery import and `/gallery` route
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` — Moved "View More" to right of heading with design-forward inline style
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` — Changed gallery nav link from `/#gallery` to `/gallery`
- `client/src/lib/translations.ts` — Added `gallery.viewMore` key in zh/en/ja

**Rationale**: User uploaded 131 sample photos (~749MB) to Azure Blob Storage and requested a dedicated gallery page accessible from homepage. User requested (1) "查看更多" at heading right with design feel, (2) show one section at a time rather than all images at once.

---

### 2026-02-28: Shop Page Carousel, UserGallery Enhancements & UI Refinements
**Summary**: Major overhaul of product shop pages and homepage UserGallery. Replaced thumbnail grids with horizontal-slide carousels, added lightbox, auto-scroll, position-based drag logic, and various UI refinements.

**Scope**:
- **Shop Page Carousel** (Product35mmF2.tsx, Product35mmF2Special.tsx): Replaced thumbnail grid with `translateX`-based horizontal slide carousel; 4s auto-play interval with dot indicators; mouse/touch drag support with position-based switching (right→left half = next, left→right half = prev); `hasDragged` ref (5px threshold) distinguishes click from drag; removed `aspect-square` constraint, using `object-contain` + `h-auto` for full image display
- **Lightbox on Shop Pages**: Added click-to-enlarge `ImageLightbox` on main product image; auto-play pauses when lightbox is open
- **Product Introduction Links**: Added "查看产品介绍 / View Introduction / 製品紹介を見る" link buttons between description and purchase section, linking to respective intro pages
- **Button Rounded Corners**: Added inline `borderRadius: '6px'` to quantity selector, add-to-cart, and buy-now buttons (workaround for `--radius: 0px` global CSS)
- **UserGallery Enhancements**: Applied same position-based drag logic; added 4s auto-scroll with pause on hover/drag/lightbox; removed `hover:opacity-90` from images; circular wrap-around for drag (last→first, first→last)
- **FlagIcon Component** (new): SVG-based flag icons for language switcher (replaces emoji flags for cross-platform consistency)
- **Header Language Switcher**: Updated to use FlagIcon component
- **Aperture Sample Images** (new): Added `35mmF2-F2.jpg` and `35mmF2-F4-8.jpg` for intro page aperture comparison section
- **Copilot Instructions**: Added mandatory pre-read context, documentation sync rules, consolidation policy, pre-commit checklist

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2.tsx` — carousel, lightbox, intro link, button corners, drag logic
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2Special.tsx` — same as above + limited edition badge overlay
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2Intro.tsx` — aperture sample images section, breadcrumb updates
- `client/src/pages/Product35mmF2SpecialIntro.tsx` — breadcrumb label fix
- `client/src/components/UserGallery.tsx` — position-based drag, auto-scroll, hover removal, circular wrap
- `client/src/components/FlagIcon.tsx` (new) — SVG flag icon component
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` — FlagIcon integration, language switcher styling
- `client/src/pages/Products.tsx` — breadcrumb label unification
- `client/public/images/35mmF2-sample-images/` (new) — aperture comparison images
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — documentation workflow rules

**Rationale**: User requested iterative UI improvements to match magazine-style editorial design: richer product browsing (carousel + lightbox), smoother interactions (drag + auto-scroll), and visual polish.

---

### 2026-02-27: Product Naming — Remove "7-element" Suffix
**Summary**: Removed "7-element" suffix from all product display names. Products now display as "35mm F/2" (standard) and "35mm F/2 特别版/特別版/Special Edition" (special). Also fixed `heroEdition` content key in ProductE39SpecialIntro.tsx so the edition label renders on a separate line in the hero section.

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` — nav labels
- `client/src/components/ProductSelectionCards.tsx` — card names
- `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` — showcase names
- `client/src/pages/Products.tsx` — product listing names (zh/en/ja)
- `client/src/pages/ProductE39.tsx` — h1 title, alt tags
- `client/src/pages/ProductE39Special.tsx` — alt tags, package list
- `client/src/pages/ProductE39Intro.tsx` — breadcrumb, heroTitle, inline paragraphs, alt tags
- `client/src/pages/ProductE39SpecialIntro.tsx` — split heroTitle/heroEdition keys, breadcrumb, inline paragraphs
- `client/src/lib/translations.ts` — timeline4Desc

**Rationale**: User decided "7-element" suffix didn't look good and requested removal.

---

### 2026-02-27: E39 Product Introduction Page — Content Expansion
**Summary**: Significantly expanded `ProductE39Intro.tsx` with detailed product information covering optical structure, aperture characteristics, craftsmanship, optical performance data, and additional usage scenarios. All content trilingual (zh/en/ja).

**Scope**:
- Replaced existing "Optical Design" section with new **Legendary Optical Architecture** section: 7E/5G Double Gaussian design, purple-gold multi-layer coating, spec mini-cards (construction, design type, coating)
- Added **Aperture Highlight** parallax quote section with cinematic background image
- Added **F2 Large Aperture** section: two-column layout comparing wide-open (F2.0) vs stopped-down (F4–F8) characteristics
- Added **Full-Metal Craftsmanship** section: crescent focus ring, 10-blade circular aperture, mechanical damping, reversed image/text layout
- Added **Optical Performance Data** section: 4-card grid (field curvature, distortion < ±0.5%, aperture blades, max aperture)
- Expanded **Usage Scenes** from 3 to 4: street documentary, environmental portrait, travel documentary, video/motion
- Added full-bleed image divider using `银色镜头不挂机特写.jpg`
- Updated product specs throughout from f/1.4 to F2.0, from 8组11片 to 7片5组, from 320g to 34mm compact length
- Updated closing statement to reflect new positioning
- Refactored scenes/perfStats into mapped arrays for cleaner JSX

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/ProductE39Intro.tsx` (full rewrite, ~221 → ~350 lines)

**Rationale**: User provided detailed E39 lens specifications and requested richer editorial content aligned with the existing magazine-style design language.

---

### 2026-02-27: Japanese Language Support (Trilingual)
**Summary**: Added full Japanese (日本語) language support, expanding the site from bilingual (zh/en) to trilingual (zh/en/ja).

**Scope**:
- Updated `LanguageContext.tsx`: Language type `'zh' | 'en'` → `'zh' | 'en' | 'ja'`, localStorage validation includes `ja`
- Added complete Japanese translation block (~200 keys) to `translations.ts` covering all sections: header, hero, products, brand story, parallax quotes, gallery, support, CTA, footer, product details (M11/Q3/SL3), lightbox
- Fixed `getTranslation` return type cast to resolve pre-existing TS2322 error

---

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

### Creating Checkpoints
Use `webdev_save_checkpoint` before major changes:
```
Description: Brief summary of changes
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Bug fixes
```

### Syncing to GitHub
After checkpoint, sync to `richard6094/camera_website`:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/camera_website
rm -rf *
cp -r /home/ubuntu/premium-brand-homepage/{client,server,shared,package.json,pnpm-lock.yaml,tsconfig.json,vite.config.ts,.gitignore} .
git add -A
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin main
```

---

## Asset Management

### Image Upload Process
1. Prepare image assets and place them in `client/public/images/`
2. Use stable file naming (prefer descriptive names or source basename)
3. Reference images in code via `/images/<filename>`
4. Keep originals in an archival folder if needed

**Example**:
```bash
cp /path/to/image.jpg client/public/images/hero-cover.jpg
# Use in code: /images/hero-cover.jpg
```

### Image Optimization
- Use WebP format when possible
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- Lazy load below-the-fold images
- Use responsive images with `srcset`

---

## Performance Considerations

### Hero Section
- Max height limit (1080px) prevents excessive image loading
- Gradient mask reduces visual artifacts on ultra-wide screens
- Parallax effect uses `transform` (GPU-accelerated)
- Auto-scroll uses `setInterval` with cleanup

### Header
- Fixed positioning with `transform` for smooth hide/show
- Passive scroll listener for better performance
- Menu auto-closes when header hides

### Images
- Product images are served as local static assets from `client/public/images`
- Lazy loading for gallery images
- Object-fit: cover for consistent aspect ratios

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested Browsers
- Chrome/Edge 90+ ✅
- Firefox 88+ ✅
- Safari 14+ ✅

### Known Issues
- Safari: Gradient mask may have slight rendering differences
- Firefox: Parallax effect may be less smooth on lower-end devices

### Polyfills Needed
- None (modern browsers only)

---

## Accessibility Checklist

### Implemented
✅ Semantic HTML elements  
✅ Alt text for all images  
✅ Keyboard navigation

✅ ARIA labels for icons  
✅ Color contrast (WCAG AA)  

### TODO
⬜ Screen reader testing  
⬜ High contrast mode support  
⬜ Reduced motion preference  
⬜ Skip to content link  

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- No user authentication (static site)
- No sensitive data storage
- No API keys in client code
- CDN URLs are public (intentional)

### Future Considerations
- If adding user accounts: Use secure authentication (OAuth)
- If adding payment: Use Stripe integration (PCI compliant)
- If adding backend: Implement CSRF protection

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- Test on multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop, ultra-wide)
- Test all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms)
- Test language switching (ZH/EN/JA)
- Test navigation (header menu, breadcrumbs, back buttons)

### Browser Testing
- Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Real device testing (iOS, Android)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Accessibility Testing
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast checker
- Focus indicator visibility
